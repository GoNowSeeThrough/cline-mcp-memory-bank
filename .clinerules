# Cline Memory Bank

A Model Context Protocol server that provides persistent project context management for AI-assisted development.

Before proceeding with any task:
1. Check active context (memory://active/context) to understand:
   - Current project state
   - Ongoing tasks
   - Recent decisions

2. Review project context (memory://project/context) for:
   - Technical stack details
   - Project guidelines
   - Architecture decisions

3. Consult decision log (memory://decisions) when:
   - Making architectural choices
   - Implementing new features
   - Modifying existing patterns

4. Update progress tracking (memory://progress):
   - Mark completed items
   - Add new in-progress tasks
   - Note blocked items

Key Rules:
- Always check memory bank before starting new tasks
- Record significant technical decisions with rationale
- Keep active context updated with current work
- Track progress changes in real-time
- Reference previous decisions when making related changes
